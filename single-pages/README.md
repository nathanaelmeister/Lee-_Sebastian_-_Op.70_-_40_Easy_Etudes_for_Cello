## Sebastian Lee; Op. 70; 40 easy Studies

if you want to use [LilyPond](http://www.lilypond.org) to compile single pages from this directory,
you will need to download the whole repository since there is other files used as `includes`
from different directories such as the `copyright.ily` from `../global-files`
